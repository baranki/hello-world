# hello-world

Hello there, guys!

Taken many steps in programming already, still feeling like a beginner though ;)

My goals: to master Python (with Django and Flask) with a bit of SQL and web stuff. Also to cook better.
My hobbies: learning languages, violin (still a newbie!), board games, escape rooms.

Keep tight and work on being happy! :)
